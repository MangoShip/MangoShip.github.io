- [N-Body Simulation](https://github.com/MangoShip/NBodyWebGPU) (July 2021 - Present)

Simulating N-Body problems using different techniques (Web Workers, QuadTree, WebGPU) to compare their performance. Worked with Professor Tyler Sorensen from UCSC. With WebGPU’s strength of no hardware requirements, WebGPU is an easily accessible tool for GPU programming even if more traditional Nvidia GPUs are widely available in the department. Also applied my experience from this project to turn into a homework assignment for CSE 113 course, allowing more students to learn about GPU programming.

IOS/Android App Development for enhancing communication between firefighters during incidents. Worked with Professor Navid Shaghaghi from SCU and other student-programmers. Developed using Android Studio to work on the Android side of the project. Got familiar with using Google Firebase to handle the app’s database. Performed a demo showcase in front of firefighters.
