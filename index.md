## About Me

My name is Mingun Cho and I will be attending University of California, Davis for my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science starting on Fall 2022, advised by Professor [John Owens](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/). I received my BS in Computer Science: Game Design at Univeristy of California, Santa Cruz in Spring 2021. After graduating from UCSC, I worked with Professor [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/) in research of memory models, specifically in Vulkan.
