## About Me

My name is Mingun Cho and I'm currently applying to graduate schools to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science for Fall 2022. I received my BS in Computer Science: Game Design at Univeristy of California, Santa Cruz in Spring 2021. My research intersts are programming languages that involve parallelism, shared-memory concurrency, reliability and optimization of memory models, and GPU programming.
